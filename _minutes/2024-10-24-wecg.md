## Meeting notes

Meeting canceled

 * [rob] Many of the usual Google and Mozilla representatives are currently absent because they are at the [Ad Filtering Dev Summit](https://adfilteringdevsummit.com/). At this exact time, Google folks are presenting “What's new in Chrome”. These sessions are recorded and will be published to Eyeo's YouTube channel.
 * [tomislav] Canceled due to most folks being out.

The next meeting will be on [Thursday, November 7th, 8 AM PST (4 PM UTC)](https://everytimezone.com/?t=672c0300,3c0). Warning: daylight saving time changes between today and the next meeting. Still 5 PM in Europe.
